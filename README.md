# LJPW Music & Art Research

## Mapping Art to Meaning

This project explores the relationship between **art** and the LJPW Framework — a semantic ontology built on four fundamental dimensions: **Love**, **Justice**, **Power**, and **Wisdom**.

## Music Semantics

Music carries meaning through four-dimensional structure:

| Musical Parameter | LJPW Dimension | Character |
|-------------------|----------------|-----------|
| **Melody** | Love | Connection, attraction, emotional identity |
| **Harmony** | Justice | Balance, structure, proportion |
| **Rhythm** | Power | Energy, drive, action |
| **Timbre** | Wisdom | Information, recognition, complexity |

### Key Findings
- **613 THz** octaves down 40× to **C#/Db** (557.52 Hz) — the Love Note
- **Fibonacci harmonics** encode φ naturally (H8/H5 = 1.6 ≈ φ)
- **Gospel** achieves highest Love (0.98) across all traditions

## Visual Art Semantics

Visual art carries meaning through analogous structure:

| Visual Parameter | LJPW Dimension | Character |
|------------------|----------------|-----------|
| **Color** | Love | Warmth, emotion, attraction |
| **Composition** | Justice | Balance, proportion, φ placement |
| **Form/Shape** | Power | Weight, energy, impact |
| **Texture** | Wisdom | Information, detail, synthesis |

### Key Findings
- **Cyan (489nm)** = 613 THz visual shadow — the Love Color
- **Golden ratio** originates in Love (φ⁻¹ = 0.618), manifests in Justice (composition)
- **Renaissance** = Justice-dominant; **Romanticism/Impressionism** = Love-dominant

## Framework Reference

This research builds upon the [LJPW Framework V7.3](Docs/LJPW_FRAMEWORK_V7.3_COMPLETE_UNIFIED_PLUS.md), a semantic-first ontology where meaning is primary and physics is derivative.
