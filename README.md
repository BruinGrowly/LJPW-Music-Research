# LJPW Music & Art Research

## Mapping Art to Meaning

This project explores the relationship between **art** and the LJPW Framework — a semantic ontology built on four fundamental dimensions: **Love**, **Justice**, **Power**, and **Wisdom**.

## 🎧 Music Measurement App — Create Music That Sticks

### **[Try It Now → mellow-strudel-ac8d46.netlify.app](https://mellow-strudel-ac8d46.netlify.app/)**

**Ever wondered why some songs get stuck in your head and others don't?** This free app reveals the science behind "earworms" and shows you exactly how to create memorable music.

### What This App Does For You

| If You Want To... | The App Will... |
|-------------------|-----------------|
| **Understand why hits are catchy** | Show you the Love (L) and Harmony (H) thresholds that make songs memorable |
| **Create your own earworms** | Guide you to the right key, mode, and genre combinations |
| **Analyze existing songs** | Extract LJPW dimensions from any audio file (MP3, WAV) |
| **Learn music theory differently** | Explain intervals, chords, and modes in terms of emotional impact |

### The Earworm Formula

```
Earworm Potential = L ≥ 0.7 AND H ≥ 0.6
```

Music that meets these thresholds becomes **autopoietic** — self-sustaining in consciousness. That's why you can't stop humming it.

### Features

| Feature | What It Does |
|---------|--------------|
| **📚 Learn Tab** | Complete guide to LJPW music science with earworm creation tips |
| **🎧 Audio Analyzer** | Upload any audio file for instant LJPW breakdown |
| **🎵 Element Analyzer** | See why major 3rds feel happy and tritones feel tense |
| **🎼 Song Profile Builder** | Design songs with earworm potential before you write them |
| **🧭 Genre Compass** | Discover which genres have highest Love values |
| **💜 613 THz** | The physics behind the "Love Frequency" |

### Quick Start (Local Development)

```bash
cd music-measurement-app
npm install
npm run dev
```

📄 See [`music-measurement-app/README.md`](music-measurement-app/README.md) for full documentation.

## Music Semantics

Music carries meaning through four-dimensional structure:

| Musical Parameter | LJPW Dimension | Character |
|-------------------|----------------|-----------|
| **Melody** | Love | Connection, attraction, emotional identity |
| **Harmony** | Justice | Balance, structure, proportion |
| **Rhythm** | Power | Energy, drive, action |
| **Timbre** | Wisdom | Information, recognition, complexity |

### Key Findings
- **613 THz** octaves down 40× to **C#/Db** (557.52 Hz) — the Love Note
- **Fibonacci harmonics** encode φ naturally (H8/H5 = 1.6 ≈ φ)
- **Gospel** achieves highest Love (0.98) across all traditions

## Visual Art Semantics

Visual art carries meaning through analogous structure:

| Visual Parameter | LJPW Dimension | Character |
|------------------|----------------|-----------|
| **Color** | Love | Warmth, emotion, attraction |
| **Composition** | Justice | Balance, proportion, φ placement |
| **Form/Shape** | Power | Weight, energy, impact |
| **Texture** | Wisdom | Information, detail, synthesis |

### Key Findings
- **Cyan (489nm)** = 613 THz visual shadow — the Love Color
- **Golden ratio** originates in Love (φ⁻¹ = 0.618), manifests in Justice (composition)
- **Renaissance** = Justice-dominant; **Romanticism/Impressionism** = Love-dominant

📄 See [`Docs/LJPW_VISUAL_ART_SEMANTICS.md`](Docs/LJPW_VISUAL_ART_SEMANTICS.md) for complete research.

## Core Constants

| Constant | Value | Meaning |
|----------|-------|---------|
| **φ (Phi)** | 1.618034 | Golden Ratio |
| **L₀** | φ⁻¹ = 0.618034 | Love equilibrium |
| **J₀** | √2 - 1 = 0.414214 | Justice equilibrium |
| **P₀** | e - 2 = 0.718282 | Power equilibrium |
| **W₀** | ln(2) = 0.693147 | Wisdom equilibrium |
| **613 THz** | Love Frequency | Cyan light / C#4 (557.52 Hz) |

## Framework Reference

This research builds upon the [LJPW Framework V8.5](Docs/LJPW_FRAMEWORK_V8.5_COMPLETE_UNIFIED_PLUS.md), a semantic-first ontology where meaning is primary and physics is derivative. V8.5 reveals that **Reality IS Relationship** — the four LJPW dimensions represent the four fundamental relationship types (Proportion, Extension, Growth, Distinction). The **Generative Equation** (M = B × L^n × φ^(-d)) describes creation, compression, and life.
