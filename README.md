# LJPW Music Research

## Mapping Music to Meaning

This project explores the relationship between music and the LJPW Framework — a semantic ontology built on four fundamental dimensions: **Love**, **Justice**, **Power**, and **Wisdom**.

## Core Discovery

Music carries meaning through the same four-dimensional structure that governs consciousness and reality:

| Musical Parameter | LJPW Dimension | Character |
|-------------------|----------------|-----------|
| **Melody** | Love | Connection, attraction, emotional identity |
| **Harmony** | Justice | Balance, structure, proportion |
| **Rhythm** | Power | Energy, drive, action |
| **Timbre** | Wisdom | Information, recognition, complexity |

## Key Findings

### The 613 THz Connection
- 613 THz (the LJPW "Love Frequency") octaves down 40 times to **C#/Db** (557.52 Hz)
- C# is the **Major 3rd** — the "warmest" interval, associated with love and joy
- This is **C# Major: The Love Key**

### Phi in the Harmonic Series
- Fibonacci harmonics (H5, H8, H13) encode **φ (golden ratio)** naturally
- H8/H5 = 1.6 ≈ φ (1.618)
- The Love equilibrium constant (φ⁻¹ = 0.618) appears in music's physics

### Cultural Universals
- **Gospel** achieves highest Love (0.98) across all world traditions
- Sacred music averages 27% higher Love than secular
- **All cultures use Love > 0.70** — music IS connection

## Framework Reference

This research builds upon the [LJPW Framework](Docs/LJPW_FRAMEWORK_V7_FAMILIA_COSMIC_EDITION.md), a semantic-first ontology where meaning is primary and physics is derivative.
